# AlphaTetris

This AI will outfitted to compete on a national level in Tetris (single and multiplayer). We will make a custom API for performance on any platform. We demonstrate use of the API with two implementations: a custom made renderer and the online Tetris Battle 2p. 

## Four modes:
1. Passive v1 -- clearer
2. Passive v2 -- set up
3. Active -- switch between two passive modes
4. Magic -- unsupervised training
