# AlphaTetris

AlphaTetris is a Tetris AI. It is implemented on top of a custom API. 

## The API

Our Tetris API is packaged separately. It can be used to host a simple game of Tetris and provides a variety of other useful methods for accessing and analyzing board and piece positions. For an example of the Tetris implementation, run `python3 client.py`. 

## The AI

Our Tetris AI does not use the client implementation described above. It runs separately on the command line, displayed in text. To see the AI in action, run `python3 tetris_ai.py`.
