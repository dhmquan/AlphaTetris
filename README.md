# AlphaTetris

This AI will outfitted to compete on a national level in Tetris (single and multiplayer). We will make a custom API for performance on any platform. Use the API for two implementations, a custom made renderer and the online Tetris Battle 2p. 

## Four modes:
	1. Passive v1 -- clearer
	2. Passive v2 -- set up
	3. Active -- switch between two passive modes
	4. Magic -- unsupervised training
