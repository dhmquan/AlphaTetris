We will train five models:
	- passive v1
	- passive v2
	- combo
	- maximizer
	- adversarial

1. Passive v1
	- this will be a passive player that will simply focus on the best possible piece placement every turn
	- local search / hand written rules
	- will use simple heuristics like minimize concavity and others

2. Passive v2
	- same as v1
	- unsupervised learning for best piece placement 

3. Combo
	- this will be a more active player that will set up a combo and then execute it
	- whichever method succeeds better (v1 or v2) trained on different modes and an extra evaluator on every turn for when to switch modes

4. Maximizer
	- this will be the combo model but trained to get the most combos in the 2:00 time limit
	- genetic algorithms? 

5. Adversarial
	- this will be the maximizer model but with the added challenge of playing against another player, which can send lines
